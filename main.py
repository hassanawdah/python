# Exercise 1: Personal Greeting
# Write a Python program that asks the user for their first and last
# name separately. Use double quotes for the input prompts.
# Then, print a greeting message using single quotes. The greeting should include their full name.


first_name = input("Enter your first name:\n")
last_name = input("Enter your last name:\n")
print('Hello, ' + first_name + ' ' + last_name + '!')
